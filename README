It's very common that in real-time games and applicationsm, you need to know
which of two events took place first. While the server's time should be
authoritative since nothing can be trusted from clients, sometimes this
calculation must be done on the client.

Rather than synchronizing the time between the client and the server, which is
usually the first thing to come to mind, the best approach is to find difference
between the server's time and the client's time, and add that difference to all
timestamps coming from the server to convert those events' server time to local
time.

This repo makes it easy for the client to learn the relative difference between
it's own time and the server's time by pinging the server and dividing the
result in two. It does so multiple times to ensure accuracy.
